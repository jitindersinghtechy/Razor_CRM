 React TypeScript App with Reusable Components and Responsive SCSS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It utilizes TypeScript for static typing, reusable components for efficient development, and SCSS with variables and mixins for a responsive and maintainable design.

## Features

* **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and improves code maintainability.
* **Reusable Components:** Promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.
* **Responsive Design:** Achieved using SCSS with variables and mixins for flexible layouts across different screen sizes.
* **SCSS:** Offers advanced styling capabilities with variables, mixins, and nested rules.
* **Create React App:** Provides a streamlined development environment.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (>= 21.7.3)
* npm or yarn

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Or using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This will open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

1.  **Build the application:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Or using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

    This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory.


## SCSS Structure

* **`_variables.scss`:** Defines global SCSS variables for colors, fonts, breakpoints, etc.
* **`_mixins.scss`:** Contains reusable SCSS mixins for responsive layouts, media queries, etc.
* **`_global.scss`:** The main SCSS file that imports variables, mixins, and other style files.
